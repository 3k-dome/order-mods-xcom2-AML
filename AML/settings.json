Any more Female Clothing Pack Updates will happen in a new, separate, stand alone mod, instead of this one, to avoid bulking up the size of the mod any further.\r\n\r\n[h1]In this Update you will find the following:[/h1]\r\n14 Torsos\r\n9 Legs\r\n47 Props\r\n\r\n[h1][b]WARNING:[/b][/h1]\r\nProper Localization meant changing the template name of each item. I strongly advice starting a new campaign. Any existing soldiers who were using items from this mod prior to the update, will now have invisible parts, and NO way to change them. I've added a new Discussion Tab to see how you can address this.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nUPDATE 1: The GREEN Update\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nIt's finally here! New additions have us over 200 items!\r\n\r\n[h1]In this Update you will find the following:[/h1]\r\n21 Torsos\r\n13 Legs\r\n40 Props\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of Soldier Armor and Tacti-cool Cosmetic Mods out there, but not nearly enough\r\ncivilian looks. This mod aims to remedy that by adding a whopping 137 different customizable\r\nitems, ranging from ragtag looks to more casual fare, and everything in between!\r\n\r\n[h1]In this Pack you will find the following:[/h1]\r\n30 Torsos\r\n19 Legs\r\n88 Props (includes L/R Arms, Scars, Facepaints, and every conceivable customization slot)\r\n\r\nFor maximum customizability, I have added same items in different categories. This means for\r\nexample, you will find the \"Aviators on Forehead\" under Helmets, Upper Face Props and Lower\r\nFace Props. You will find the \"Drum Jacket\" under Torso Deco, L and R Arm Decos.\r\n\r\nIf you find this method clutters your lists or spawns horrible looking rookies, instructions\r\non how to add and remove items can be found in the ReadMe, as well as inside each of the\r\n3 individual XComContent.ini files; Torso Pack, Leg Pack and Props Pack folders.\r\n\r\nYou can find them here: ...Steam Games/steamapps/workshop/content/268500/1586643354/Config\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, every item has been re-fitted and re-rigged to xcom proportions, and with only\r\na handful of particulars, the vast majority of items work in beautiful harmony. All Jackets\r\nand Decos fit over most Torsos. That said, I am not a professional, so please excuse some very,\r\nvery minor clipping on a few of these.\r\n\r\n[h1]Please keep in mind, these are for Female soldiers only.[/h1]\r\n[h1]There are currently no plans for a Male Pack.[/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1][b]SOFT REQUIREMENT :[/b][/h1]\r\n- [u]Anarchy's Children DLC.[/u] Few items in this pack use materials and textures from this DLC, such as the Hot Shorts, Knuckle Duster gloves, Ammo Gauntlets and a few others. Note, it is a SOFT requirement. If you do not own this DLC, you can still use this mod. At worse, those few items won't display those textures correctly.\r\n\r\nNo copyright infringement intended, this is purely a work of passion and fandom! All assets are owned by their original creators.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this mod, please don't forget to rate and favorite it, it really helps! Take pictures!

Thank you all so much!\r\n\r\n[h1][b]FAQ[/b][/h1]\r\n[b][u]1. WOTC Only?? That's just a stupid zombie cash grab. Vanilla when?[/u][/b]\r\n- WOTC only. There will be no vanilla version coming.\r\n\r\n[b][u]2. But... why though?[/u][/b]\r\n- As explained before, while WOTC is indeed an expansion to XCOM 2, in terms of \"under the hood\", they could very well be two different games. This presents huge complications to us modders. Each version of the game has it's own separate 90+ GB SDK. Many, myself included, don't have the space.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, many things changed from one to the other; new coding scripts, new texture and material shaders, etc. So even if we did have the space for both, we can't just compile the assets in each, and be done with it. Much needs to change with how each piece is added to the game. The assets need to be reworked, the textures need to be heavily altered, sometimes even start from scratch, code needs to be rewritten, etc. I hope this clarifies why many modders have left vanilla behind. \r\n\r\n[b][u]3. Dudes? Who uses dudes? Where's the female salon?[/u][/b]\r\n- We got you covered right here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1471399748\r\n\r\n[b][u]4. Some of the beards clip through some of the faces, what gives?[/u][/b]\r\n- Making beards requires rigging them to each face bone(there's 50+ bones). It's essentially like making faces, which is a huge time investment and very difficult to do. On top of that, each one would require a specific, individual Morph Target, to account for each face of each race. This is simply beyond our skill level and scope of understanding.\r\n\r\n[b][u]5. I like many of these, but I dislike many as well. Could you give us a How-To to remove those?[/u][/b]\r\n- Sure thing, my friend. First you'll want to navigate to the mod's Config Folder. You can find it here: \r\n\r\n...Steam Games/steamapps/workshop/content/268500/1733669574/Config\r\n\r\nInside you will find a file named XComContent.ini. Open it, and simply place a semicolon (;) in front\r\nof the line of the item you want the game to ignore. The line you're looking for looks like this:\r\n\r\n+BodyPartTemplateConfig=(PartType=\"Hair\", ......\r\n\r\nAfter you're done with your magic, it'll look like this:\r\n\r\n;+BodyPartTemplateConfig=(PartType=\"Hair\", ......\r\n\r\n[b][u]6. What's your To-Do list look like?[/u][/b]\r\n- In no particular order:\r\nUpdate Female Hair Pack\r\nUpdate Female Clothing Pack\r\nFace Pack\r\nME Squadmates\r\n\r\n[h1][u]I hate you and everything you stand for, but I still wanna throw some money your way. How?[/u][/h1]\r\n- Things have changed. I won't bore you with specifics, but suffice to say, 2020 didn't skip me with it's \"let's-utterly-destroy-this-person's-life\" stick. First and foremost, it's important that I state I will NEVER gate content behind a pay wall. Every thing I do for the community, is and will continue to be free and for everyone.

            "Description": "Adds new functionality to Character Pool and new interface to manage units' appearance, as well as an automated Uniform Manager.\r\n\r\nFor a brief overview of the mod's functions, check the introduction video above, or click the link below for an in-depth explanation.\r\n\r\n[b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2664422411/3194737075878800834/]>>> DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS <<<[/url][/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]New Soldier Customization UI[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] New \"Manage Appearance\" screen. Allows copying units' entire or partial appearance onto other units, as well as importing soldier appearance from Character Pool or Memorial, or putting uniforms on soldiers. You can also make sweeping changes to your entire Squad, Barracks or Character Pool. This can be used, for example, to quickly set the same camouflage for the entire Squad.\r\n[*] New \"Stored Appearance\" screen. Allows viewing, \"equipping\" and deleting stored appearance for each armor the soldier have ever equipped.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Character Pool Changes[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Character Pool soldier list is now sorted and shows soldiers' class.\r\n[*] A \"Search\" button has been added to quickly filter out soldiers based on their name or class.\r\n[*] You can now Shift+Click to select or deselect multiple soldiers in Character Pool.\r\n[*] Character Pool now saves Appearance Store - individual unit appearance for each armor.\r\n[*] It's now possible to pre-customize appearance of Character Pool units for each armor by equipping said armor on the new Loadout screen. Weapons can also be previewed in Character Pool.\r\n[*] \"Dormant\" character pool units that do not appear in the campaign are now allowed.\r\n[*] Appearance validation is now turned off in debug game mode, and can be also turned off in normal game mode. Appearance validation is the game attempting to correct the appearance of Character Pool units if their cosmetic body parts become missing, typically because cosmetic mods with those body parts have been deactivated. Disabling validation allows temporarily disabling cosmetic mods without losing the customized appearance of your Character Pool. If appearance validation is currently disabled, a new button is added to soldier customization screen to perform it manually for specific soldiers.\r\n[*] Individual Character Pool units can be converted to Uniforms. Uniforms are grouped separately on the Manage Appearance screen, and may be applied to soldiers manually or automatically.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Automated Uniform Manager[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] When soldiers equip new armor for the first time, the mod will look for a suitable Uniform in Character Pool, and apply it automatically. \r\n[*] Individual soldiers and Uniforms can be excluded from participating in this automated process.\r\n[*] This system can be disabled globally in Mod Config Menu. If disabled globally, individual units can still be included in the automated process.\r\n[*] You can also work with Uniforms manually using the Manage Appearance screen.\r\n[*] Uniforms can be shared through Character Pool files.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Automated Backups[/h1]\r\n\r\nIf you start the game with Appearance Manager disabled, there's a high chance all of the extra information about Character Pool units, like their Appearance Store and uniform status, will be lost. To prevent you from potentially losing hours of customizing your character pool, Appearance Manager makes automatic backups of the character pool. \r\n\r\nThe next time you start the game with Appearance Manager enabled, you will get a pop-up message asking whether you want to restore the Character Pool from backup.\r\n\r\n[h1]Be careful with[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Any stored appearance on the Uniform unit will count as a potential uniform, so when you are done setting up a uniform, make sure to go to Stored Appearance screen and delete any unwanted appearances.\r\n[*] Be very careful when you [b]Apply Changes[/b] to multiple units. Double check cosmetic options you have enabled, otherwise you might accidentally give the same face to all soldiers in your barracks, for example.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495][b]X2 WOTC Community Highlander[/b][/url] is required.\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300][b][WotC] Mod Config Menu[/b][/url] is supported, but not a hard requirement.\r\n[*]Safe to add or remove mid-campaign.[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]COMPATIBILITY WITH UNRESTRICTED CUSTOMIZATION[/h1]\r\n\r\nAppearance Manager has limited compatibility with [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1135440846]Unrestricted Customization - Wotc[/url][/b] and its [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2438621356]Redux version[/url][/b]. They make Appearance Store a mess, so Stored Appearance screen becomes useless. Manage Apperance screen is switched into compatibility mode where you can import only other units' current appearance.\r\n\r\nYou should still be able to set up and apply uniforms automatically or manually, but you will have to use one Uniform unit per appearance, storing appearances for different armors  within one uniform unit will become impossible.\r\n\r\n[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]\r\n\r\nAppearance Manager replaces [i][b]CharacterPoolManager[/b][/i] and will be incompatible with any mod that does the same. It also has the following ModClassOverrides:\r\n[code]\r\nUICharacterPool - can be safely disabled by removing its entry in this mod's XComEngine.ini. Doing so will disable sorting and the \"Search\" button.\r\n\r\nUICharacterPool_ListPools - required for the mod to Import and Export additional information to and from Character Pool files created with this mod.[/code][list]\r\n[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1136878667]WOTC Extended Character Pool[/url][/b], Sorted Character Pool, [WOTC] Sort Characters by Callsign - compatible if you disable Appearance Manager's ModClassOverride for [b][i]UICharacterPool[/i][/b].\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nOther than that, should be compatible with anything and everything.\r\n\r\n[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]\r\n\r\nPresets and MCM settings for this mod are stored in this file.

Those are annoying, but completely harmless, and fixing them all would require more effort and Highlander changes than it's worth.\r\n\r\n[h1]CREDITS[/h1]\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to [b]Xymanek (Astral Descend)[/b] for crucial code support and UI improvements.\r\nThanks to my beta testers: [b]RustyDios, lago508, Deadput[/b].\r\nBlame [b]Veehementia[/b] for making me think that making this mod was a good idea.\r\n\r\nPlease [b][url=https://www.patreon.com/Iridar]support me on Patreon[/url][/b] if you require tech support, have a suggestion for a feature, or simply wish to help me create more awesome mods.",

I missed TWO holiday season releases, and I wasn't gonna let a 3rd one slip by. No, sir. Here is the initial release of FCP 2.0!!\r\n\r\nThe effort to keep our soldiers in civilian gear continues! The Female Clothing Pack 2.0 (FCP2)\r\narrives with all sorts of new items to maximize your soldier's customization options!\r\n\r\n[h1]In this Pack you will find the following:[/h1]\r\n- 9 Torsos\r\n- 9 Legs\r\n- 5 Arms\r\n- 8 Head Props\r\n- 28 Body Props\r\n\r\n[h1][b]SOFT REQUIREMENT :[/b][/h1]\r\n- [u]Anarchy's Children DLC.[/u] Few items in this pack use materials and textures from this DLC. Note, it is a SOFT requirement. If you do not own this DLC, you can still use this mod. At worse, those few items won't display those textures correctly.\r\n\r\nFor maximum customizability, I have added same items in different categories. This means for\r\nexample, you will find NECKLACES under ArmDeco categories, in addition to their proper place.\r\n\r\nIf you find this method clutters your lists or spawns horrible looking rookies, instructions\r\non how to add and remove items can be found inside each of the individual XComContent.ini files.\r\n\r\nYou can find them here: ...Steam Games/steamapps/workshop/content/268500/2688627224/Config/INITIAL_RELEASE\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, every item has been re-fitted and re-rigged to xcom proportions, and with only\r\na handful of particulars, the vast majority of items work in beautiful harmony. All Jackets\r\nand Decos fit over most Torsos. That said, I am not a professional, so please excuse some very,\r\nvery minor clipping on a few of these.\r\n\r\nNo copyright infringement intended, this is purely a work of passion and fandom! All assets are owned by their original creators.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this mod, please don't forget to rate and favorite it, it really helps! Take pictures!

Thank you all so much!\r\n[b]TeK DeLorean[/b] - Providing the amazing GITS:FA texture sets for me to work on.\r\n[b]Christopher Odd[/b] - You provided me with a home and a fun community. You have my eternal gratitude, good sir.\r\n[b]Modpocalypse Ex Machina Evolution Gang (MEME)[/b] - Inspiring me to get off my lazy butt, and get to work!\r\n\r\n[h1][b]FAQ[/b][/h1]\r\n[b][u]1. WOTC Only?? That's just a stupid zombie cash grab. Vanilla when?[/u][/b]\r\n- WOTC only. Every time you ask for a mod's Vanilla version, a puppy is killed.\r\n\r\n[b][u]2. Is this compatible with FCP 1.0?[/u][/b]\r\n- Yes!!! 100%, barring a few items that just aren't meant to be worn together. But yes, consider this as an extension to FCP 1.0.\r\n\r\n[b][u]3. Is more coming?[/u][/b]\r\n- Always. Tons more. Until Jake announces X3. This is simply the initial release, to get the ball rolling. \r\n\r\n[b][u]4. GITS Modest Torsos... the T-Shirts don't have textures?[/u][/b]\r\n- Wanted to push the initial release ASAP as a Holiday Gift!! Will return to it soon (TM). If it's too jarring, I suggest following the instructions on how to comment out items.\r\n\r\n[h1][u]I hate you and everything you stand for, but I still wanna throw some money your way. How?[/u][/h1]\r\n- Things have changed. I won't bore you with specifics, but suffice to say, 2020 didn't skip me with it's \"let's-utterly-destroy-this-person's-life\" stick. First and foremost, it's important that I state I will NEVER gate content behind a pay wall. Every thing I do for the community, is and will continue to be free and for everyone. That said, if you have enjoyed my mods as much as I've enjoyed making them, and would like to thank, tip, or support my modding endeavor, you can do so here!! : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kexx",

I may or may not keep this version published depending on user reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis mod forces the game to use your specified class in the character pool, when it \r\npromotes rookies from the After Action screen. It also changes logic to \r\nhonor the character pool class when giving a soldier as a mission reward.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nThe mod matches any character by first and last name in your character pool, \r\nand uses your selected class.\r\n\r\nIf you have the soldier defined as a Rookie, the game will assign a class randomly, \r\njust as it currently does.\r\n\r\nIf you have the soldier defined as a Psi Operative, it will assign a PsiOperative,\r\nhowever, that soldier will not be trainable until the requisite facility is built.\r\n\r\nIf you are having problems getting it to work...\r\nPlease read the pinned discussion section below first for suggestions on how to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find this mod useful, a thumbs up would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY:\r\n\r\nUpdate 6/14/2016:\r\nReplaced class override for X2StrategyElement_DefaultRewards, to hopefully help reduce conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 6/25/2016:\r\nOpened up logic to allow soldiers to be promoted to Psi Operatives.\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n1. The soldier will have no powers at his disposal until the Psi Ops facility is build \r\nand he begins training.\r\n2. Soldiers given as mission rewards will also have no powers until they begin training, \r\nregardless of starting rank.\r\n3. These soldiers will need to be started out in the Psi Ops facility just like rookies to begin \r\ntheir powers training. Until this starts, they only have the rifle and are of limited use on\r\nmissions. They will be listed in the drop down along with any rookies you have available.",

If it's the problem with the Reaction Fire Sequencer or the wait on \"nothing\", then the lock won't happen at all. For the other fixes, the intial freeze will almost certianly still happen, but the game should be more likely to free itself.\r\n\r\n[h1][b]Actual changes made by this mod (warning this list is a bit technical!)[/b][/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]'X2ReactionFireSequencer' No longer marks all shots by the same shooter against the same target in the same sequence as \"started\" when the first shot starts, this stops the later shots from starting at all!\r\n[*]'X2Action_WaitForAnotherAction' will Tme Out after 60 seconds and stop waiting regardless.\r\n[*]'X2Action_WaitForDestructibleActorActionTrigger' will not wait at all if it is set to wait on \"nothing\", which would otherwise lock it indefinitely. A similar fix was made to 'X2Action_WaitForAnotherAction' in the October Patch.\r\n[*]'X2Action_WaitForDestructibleActorActionTrigger' is also given a 60 second Time Out.\r\n[*]'X2Action_MoveDirect' will not wait for the \"Stopping\" animation triggered when it Times Out to finish.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1][b]Other Advice![/b][/h1]\r\nit is possible to free visualization \"soft locks\" with a console command, and I don't promise that this mod will deal with all possible visualization problems!. To enable the console, add -allowConsole to the command line/launch options. The actual key to drop the console varies with regional keyboard variants, but with a US keyboard is is the tilde key (~) above the tab key, with a UK keyboard, it is the apostrophe/@ key.\r\n\r\n[b]Instructions[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Type X2DebugVisualizer at the console.\r\n[*]A pretty(?) UI overlay should appear, for you, the important thing is the \"Clear Hangs\" button in the top Left. Click it!\r\n[*]Type  X2DebugVisualizer at the console again to clear the visualizer debugging UI overlay.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1][b]Compatability[/b][/h1]\r\nOverrides:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]X2ReactionFireSequencer\r\n[*]X2Action_WaitForAnotherAction\r\n[*]X2Action_WaitForDestructibleActorActionTrigger\r\n[*]'X2Action_MoveDirect\r\n[/list]\r\nThese are quite technical classes, and it is unlikely that they will be overriden for non bug fixing reasons. Nonethess, this mod will not be compatbile with mods which override any of these three classes.\r\n\r\n[h1][b]Other Mods by me[/b][/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]WOTC Compatible[/b] (non-WOTC versions also exist if appropriate)\r\n[list]\r\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124794449]Cinematic Rapid Fire[/url], which gives Rapid Fire and Chain Shot their cinematic camera back which was removed in the patch ages ago.

It's a middle-ground between NO choice (base game) and ANY choice (Commanders Choice). It's similar to the promotion mechanics in EU/EW.\r\n\r\nMakes a good companion mod to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125727531] [b][WOTC] Use My Class[/b] [/url] - by default, the first class option will be reserved for the class specified in the unit's character pool template, if applicable and available (this behavior can also be toggled to always fully random choices, if desired).\r\n\r\nDesigned to work with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148535137] [b][WOTC] Disable Any Class[/b] [/url], an easy way to manage enabling/disabling individual classes without worrying about config changes being overwritten during updates (Note: sometimes this is finicky and may take resetting the choices in the Disable Any Class MCM menu a time or two to properly take effect.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe options available to a soldier may change a bit when either adding/removing new classes from rotation, changing relative weights of classes (class NumInDeck values), or toggling the UseMyClass option reserving the first choice to the character pool defined class. This is all by design - in general, you are stuck with the handful of options from the pool given to each soldier (or *gasp* use the GTS!?!), but changes to the pool of available classes WILL get filtered in. Adding, removing, and updating mods shouldn't break your unpromoted rookies.\r\n\r\n[h1]Known [Minor] Issues[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] This is intended as an alternative, but you CAN run it alongside Commander's Choice if you want - though there will be some small cosmetic spacing issues with the menus if you run them both at the same time.\r\n[*] This is heavily based on Commander's Choice and has many of the same minor issues (using the arrow keys on a class' ability tree to navigate to a promotable rookie will promote them randomly like the base game, etc.).\r\n[*] Uses a pseudo-random roll to prevent the class options from re-rolling every time you click the button - works well, but the complexity of that roll may need to be increased in the future if strong patterns become apparant over time (like the first units of campaigns always rolling similar options, etc.) - let me know if things start to get too predictable.\r\n[*] The default value of 3 choices is probably too many if you are only playing with the 4 base game classes (zzzz) - I would advise adjusting it down to 2 in that situation.\r\n[*] Bad preview image is bad. Sorry.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Thanks and Credits[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis is largely based on Commander's Choice, so credit to those guys for amazing work on a long-time staple. Also big thanks to robojumper for helping point me in the right direction for storing the available choices with the pseudo-random rolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Version History[/h1] (See Change Notes for full history)\r\n[list]\r\n1.0.7:[list]\r\n[*] Updated some GameState handling to hopefully fix issues with other mods making changes in armory.[/list]\r\n[/list]",

Known only as â€œZeroâ€, she was hellbent on one goal: [b]to kill all of her sisters.[/b] \r\n\r\nHer sisters were praised and loved by many all over the world, taking rank as high governmental officials for ADVENT. The world viewed Zero, however, with malice, calling her a â€œcriminalâ€ and a â€œtraitorâ€. For many years she had attempted countless times tracking down her sisters, all of which failed immensely.\r\n\r\nShe needed help. But who was willing to help her when the whole world was against her?\r\n\r\nLuckily, there was. The only ones that did belong to a group of outsiders who bow to no one and hate ADVENT with all their guts.\r\n\r\nâ€¦ that group, was XCOM. And that was where her story begins.[/h1]\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[h1]\"And that makes 25, Commander. 25 people in this ship so far that Zero \"did\" to. You got to tell her to stop, Commander. \"Menace\", Kelly, and so many others fell victim to her charms. I only hope you didn't do the same. We are a military resistance group, not a place for... y'know, [b]that[/b]...\r\n\r\nI swear if she does one more person I am going to personally kick her off the damn ship.\"[/h1]\r\n\r\n-- Central Officer Bradford\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]DESCRIPTION [/h1]\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCommanders of XCOM, I give you another new mod from the Drakengard series: Zeroâ€™s Outfit!\r\n\r\n[b]This mod adds in only the female variation of the armor. (Pffft as if guys can wear this)[/b]\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nIn detail:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Zero's armor (colorable) for FEMALES ONLY!\r\n[*] Zeroâ€™s hair with physics (also has colorable ribbon)!\r\n[*] Zeroâ€™s flower for Upper/Lower face props!\r\n[*] Zeroâ€™s pieces for Torso Gear and Thigh Deco and Right Forearm (Has physics)!\r\nNOTE: These are REQUIRED to fill in the rest of the outfit\r\n[*] Individual Arms included!\r\n[/list]\r\n[/quote]\r\n[h1] Thanks! Enjoy! Feedback is welcome (good and/or bad)! And don't forget to give it a thumbs-up! [/h1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] FAQ TIME: [/h1]\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n[i] Q1 PART I) [OBLIGATORY] Can you port (insert something from Drakengard 3)?! [/i]\r\n\r\nNot really no.\r\n\r\n[i] Q1 PART II) [OBLIGATORY] Can you port to Vanilla XCOM 2? [/i]\r\n\r\nNope. I am NOT going to port anymore mods to Vanilla. It's a pain to convert it to Vanilla (even switching it back to it when I have mods for WotC is troubling enough for me). [b]If you want to do it then by all means go for it. Don't forget to give credit for the original mod.[/b]\r\n\r\n[i] Q2) Why are some of the parts listed as essential for the Torso/Thigh parts? [/i]\r\n\r\nTo make Zero's dress enable physics, I had to cut up the pieces and divide them into deco pieces -- that's just how the game works. Sorry for this workaround.\r\n\r\n[i] Q3 ) Donations? Aeronautic senpai please? [/i]\r\n\r\nKilling intoners doesn't require donations.\r\n\r\n[i] Q4 ) Why do girls stuff? C'mon man what about guys?

But with it, came private military corporations as well to aide ADVENT. \r\n\r\nOnly one PMC rebelled against them for 20 long years: [b]the Griffin & Kryuger Military Contractor and Security Consultancy Services[/b] -- [b]G&K for short[/b].\r\n\r\nTheir secret weapon was the heavily modified design of the ADVENT MECS: [b]Tactical Dolls -- or T-Dolls, for short[/b]. Unlike the MECS, these T-Dolls are more agile in their design and fierce in their combat abilities. They also have the same sentience and personalities as humans, thus giving them a human-like design. Ultimately, these androids serve one purpose: [b]to fight on the frontlines and save humanity.[/b] In support of this, their long-standing list of T-Dolls was named after the weapons of the Old World. This organization helped the Resistance around the globe for many years fighting despite ADVENT scrutiny...\r\n\r\n...up until XCOM was back from the ashes.\r\n\r\nWith the revival of XCOM, G&Kâ€™s finest and newest Commander (known only as the â€œShikikanâ€) personally donated one of G&K's finest T-Dolls to XCOM (with the approval of General Kryuger), in hopes of aiding the fight.\r\n\r\n[b]That T-Doll is â€œAN-94â€, a cold and quiet soldier of Team DEFY. She is the first, of possibly many, T-Dolls to join XCOM...[/b]\r\n [/h1]\r\n [/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[i][h1]\"Hello, Commander.\r\n\r\nI, AN-94, will be under your command from now onâ€¦\r\n\r\nUmâ€¦ I want to askâ€¦ No, nevermindâ€¦\"[/h1][/i]\r\n\r\n- T-DOLL No. 205, â€œAN-94â€, Soldier of Team DEFY (G & K) and XCOM \r\n [/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]DESCRIPTION[/h1]\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCommanders of XCOM, I give you another new mod from the Girls Frontline series: AN-94's Gear! \r\n\r\nUnlike other anime-styled mods in the Workshop, the model is nicely fitting into the realism style of XCOM. This model is from the Chinese version of Call of Duty Mobile. This will probably hold us over until GFL 2: Exilium comes out lol.\r\n\r\n[b]This mod adds in detail:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[list] \r\n[*] AN-94â€™s Outfit (colorable) for FEMALES ONLY!\r\n[*] AN-94â€™s Hairstyle (Colorable and has physics)!\r\n[*] AN-94â€™s Mask for Upper, Lower, and Helmet props!\r\n[*] Individual arms included!\r\n[*] 3 Torso and Leg options available!\r\n[*] 1 Torso Gear option available!\r\n[*] 1 Thigh Gear option available!\r\n[/list]\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Thanks!

Hence, the Highlander tries to address as many use cases as possible. Not counting fixing bugs, the Highlander does not change the behavior of the game, it merely provides ways for other mods to do so.\r\n\r\nEverything that goes into Highlander undergoes rigorous testing and peer review. \r\n\r\n[h1]How do I use the Highlander?[/h1]\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the mod and enable it in your mod launcher like you would any other. You should see the Highlander's name and current version appear in the lower right corner of the game's main menu screen.\r\n\r\n[h1] Alien Hunters DLC Plugin[/h1]\r\n\r\nIf you have [b]Alien Hunters DLC[/b] installed and enabled, and you are using this version of the Highlander, then you also should install the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2534737016][b][WOTC] Alien Hunters Community Highlander[/b][/url] plugin as well.\r\n\r\nDo [b][i]NOT[/i][/b] install that plugin if you do [b][i]NOT[/i][/b] have the Alien Hunters DLC.\r\n\r\n[h1]Useful Links[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b][url=https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/wiki/Troubleshooting]Highlander Troubleshooting[/url][/b] - if you have issues running the game with Highlander active.\r\n[*] [b][url=https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/mod_troubleshooting]Mod Troubleshooting[/url][/b] - for issues with other mods.\r\n[*] [b][url=https://x2communitycore.github.io/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander]Highlander Documentation[/url][/b] - for modmakers.\r\n[*] [b][url=https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander]Highlander GitHub Page[/url][/b] - for issue reports and contributions.[/list]\r\n\r\nThank you for using the Highlander.

Some mods require this mod in order for you to use the in-game configuration menus. \r\n\r\nFor full details on using this mod, troubleshooting, or even building your own mods to use this menu, visit: https://github.com/andrewgu/ModConfigMenu \r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nNexus Link: http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom2/mods/573/\r\n\r\nThis version has been updated for War of the Chosen. For a version compatible with the base game, look for \"Mod Config Menu Legacy\" here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122831824\r\n\r\nLatest Update:\r\n\r\n- Bug fix for an issue from the previous update that caused some mods to fail to save settings.\r\n\r\nPrevious Update:\r\n\r\n- Performance improvements to make the options menu load faster and close faster, especially if you have a lot of mods.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nCompatiblity:\r\n\r\n- Works with the Tactical Legacy Pack update.\r\n- Compatible with WotC.\r\n\r\nGo here for the legacy version, which supports the original base game: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122831824\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing compatibility issues, as always, feel free to notify me in the comments.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nNOTICE FOR PEOPLE REPORTING THAT THIS MOD IS CAUSING IN-GAME PROBLEMS:\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has taken the time to report issues with MCM. It obviously sucks if the options menu, of all things, is what's breaking your game, and I'd like to get these issues addressed ASAP. However, it's next to impossible for me to test every version of every mod that also uses MCM, so I need your help as well to troubleshoot issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are seeing graphical glitches or problems transitioning between Avenger/Missions, please check two very specific details for me and let me know the result in your comment: \r\n\r\n1. If you turn off all mods except MCM, does the problem still happen?\r\n2. Does the problem happen only after you've visited the Options screen, only after you've visited the Mod Options screen, or regardless of whether you've visited either screen?\r\n\r\nBecause of how extensively MCM interacts with other mods and how certain UI components interact, these two details will help me a lot with pinpointing the problem.\r\n",

Because the Avenger is disgusting as hell and so is the planet due to its filthy stains: ADVENT. What better way to call in some help in cleanup while looking cute as hell than having maids?!\r\n\r\nIn addition, the outfits are colorable and have different leg options due to numerous shoe options (later on in an update, probably). Cause why not?\r\n\r\nAnyways they are as follows:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] The sleeved default maid outfit for FEMALES ONLY (colorable) (Bare arms work well with this!)\r\n[*] Maid hat and hair bowties for FEMALES ONLY (colorable) (Helmet, Upper, and Lower Face props applicable)\r\n[*] The lewd maid outfit for FEMALES ONLY (colorable) (NSFW; DISABLED BY DEFAULT; READ FAQ FOR MORE INFO) [/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Thanks!

It's because of your... uh...\r\n\r\n... well your [b]'honkers'[/b], to put it bluntly. None of the Kevlar vests are big enough to fit them in easily and make them too squished. I'm sure we can ask Shen something to help fix it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I guess you can use your school outfit to fight for the time being.\r\n\r\n... and no you cannot wear the Newcomer outfit either -- Central hates it. Last thing we want is all of XCOM troops not hitting their shots because they got distracted staring at you and your big chest.\"[/h1]\r\n\r\n[i]- \"Menace\", Soldier of XCOM[/i]\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[h1] \"Honoka's big chest is filled with hopes and dreams...\"[/h1]\r\n\r\n[i]- The Commander, probably[/i]\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]DESCRIPTION [/h1]\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCommanders of XCOM, I give you another new mod from the Dead or Alive series: Honoka's Outfits!\r\n\r\n[b]This mod adds in only 6 female outfits as well as a few other outfit pieces from DOA.\r\n\r\nAnyways they are as follows:\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] 8 outfits from Dead or Alive 6's Honoka with varying Arms, Legs, and Torso options (colorable) for FEMALES only! [spoiler]Plus 2 special outfits that can only be enabled within the mod folder.[/spoiler]\r\n[*] Individual Arms options included!\r\n[/list]\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Thanks! Enjoy! Feedback is welcome (good and/or bad)! And don't forget to give it a thumbs-up! [/h1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] FAQ TIME: [/h1]\r\n\r\n[i] Q1 PARI I) [OBLIGATORY] What happened to the Newcomer outfit? I thought that was included in it too? [/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Dunno what you're talking about. I will say this though: I recommend you check the XComContent.ini and the XComGame.int in their respective folders to enable/disable certain options for cosmetics. I may or may not have included extra goodies in there too. Duuno what you may find though.\r\n\r\nThe mod is located here:\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\268500\\2700371757[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Q1 PART II) [OBLIGATORY] Can you port to Vanilla XCOM 2? [/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Nope. I am NOT going to port anymore mods to Vanilla. It's a pain to convert it to Vanilla (even switching it back to it when I have mods for WotC is troubling enough for me). [b]If you want to do it then by all means go for it. Don't forget to give credit for the original mod.[/b]\r\n\r\n(I mean c'mon, why port THIS to vanilla anyway?)\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Q2) WOW! You can do armor now?! Can you do -- [/i]\r\n\r\nNope. I don't do requests. Suggestions are noted however. Doesn't mean I'll get to it though.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Q3) Donations? Aeronautic senpai please? [/i]\r\n\r\nNinjas don't need donations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Q4 ) Disgusting weeb. Keep that filth in Japan. [/i]\r\n\r\nToo late. The world is filled with ADVENT filth. Time to purge the xeno scum by usin' skimpy girl fighters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Q5 ) That looks like DOA hair! Can you do publish that mod?! [/i]\r\n\r\nToo many bones make Aero a dull boy. I could, but it takes forever to do. Do you see how flowy their hair is!? Yeah, thats a LOT of bones to deal with. We'll see, but don't hold your breath. Until then, wait, bother kexx, or try it yourself and prove me wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nGot anymore questions? Put in the comments below if you wish. Anyways, ENJOY THE MOD GUYS!\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] KNOWN ISSUES [/h1]\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* Honoka's Neko Sci-Fi outfit has emissive colors that can be changed by altering the secondary armor tint. It isn't perfect, however, as if you make it white, it is still pink. I am looking into that issue as of now and still figuring that out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] CREDITS [/h1]\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n+ [b] Firaxis and 2K [/b] for this wonderful game as well as giving the community this SDK to further expand XCOM's capabilities\r\n\r\n+ [b] Team NINJA and Tecmo Koei [/b] for Dead or Alive, the best weeaboo fanservicey fighting game.\r\n\r\n+ [b] The modders at the Lab of Lovers [/b] for the qrdbtool that helps extract the DOA assets. This mod would not have been possible if it weren't for the tools. Thank you!\r\n\r\n+ [b] Irokichigal01 [/b] for the XNALARA model/texture work on one of the other outfits -- an outfit port from DOA 5 that I thought would be nice to bring to.

You're supposed to watch your opponent when you fight.\r\n\r\n[h1]INCLUDES:[/h1]\r\n- Hair, Lower Face Prop/ Upper Face Prop, Torso, Left Arm, Right Arm, Legs, Torso Gear, Thigh parts.\r\n- Default and Colorable options.\r\nApplies to all 3 armor tiers and faction units.\r\n\r\nThumbs up if you like this mod :D\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to .vhs and nekoworkshop :)\r\n\r\n[h1]INSTRUCTIONS[/h1]\r\nThis mod includes cosmetic items that are assigned to parts that may be hidden (eg. forearms, shoulder, torso gear, thighs and shins) to selection.

Simply put, this is how the game works. If this is the case for you, the simplest way to fix it is to subscribe to the following mods: \r\n\r\nMr. Kablamm0Fish's Empty WOTC Deco Slot (unlock these parts for standard XCOM soldiers)\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127014384\r\n\r\nand Nekoworkshop's Invisible Parts for Hero (Faction) Units (for the Hero classes).\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125697296\r\n\r\nQ: Tattoos are appearing stretched/ clipped on the torso, can you fix it?\r\nA: Unlike the bodies from the main game that do not accpet tattoos applying on the body, this torso body does.There is no perfect solution to \"fix\" this problem aside from either entirely disable tatoos to be accepted on the torso (where tattoos can create jarring cut off lines where the arm and the torso meets anyway), or create entire new sets of Tatoos with fixed UVs. As such I have decided to leave it as is.\r\n\r\nQ: Vanilla Version?\r\nA: There are no plans for vanilla version for any of my mods since I started modding way after WOTC was released. And because it's way too much of a PITA. If you so want to port it over yourself and have proven skills to do so, contact me. :)\r\n\r\nQ: Add face please?\r\nA: When I know how and have the time to do so.\r\n\r\nQ: I have a nifty screenshot featuring the mod, can it be featured on the preview screens?\r\nA: Yes! I'm running out of ideas for cool screenshots, in fact I would encourage you to post a steam screenshot link down below, and I'll choose some nifty ones to be up there, with credits for your image :)\r\n\r\n[h1]KNOWN ISSUES:[/h1]\r\nScarf wing prop visual may not refresh within customization screen upon unequipping. It is only a temporary visual error, you can still customize your soldier as usual. Back out the customization screen will fix it. Will fix when I find a solution.\r\n \r\n[h1]DISCLAIMER:[/h1]\r\nAll content belongs to their respective original author(s).
